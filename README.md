# Random Password Generator 

## Project Description

The Random Password Generator is a simple tool designed to generate strong and random passwords for better security. It allows users to generate passwords of varying lengths with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, making them suitable for use across a variety of online accounts and applications.

## Goals

- **Password Generation:** Develop a program that generates random passwords according to user-defined length and complexity requirements.

- **Security:** Ensure that the generated passwords are stored in an encrypted form.

- **Password Strength Evaluation:** Implement a mechanism to evaluate and display the strength of the generated password.

- **Save to File:** Offer an option to save the generated passwords to a file for later use.

- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for cases such as invalid user input or unexpected errors during password generation.

## Specifications

- The desired length of the password and whether it contains uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special symbols should be as per the specifications of the user.

### Language

- Built using C language.
  
 
## Design

This tool focuses on simplicity and usablility. Users can generate random and strong passwords based on their own specifications.
